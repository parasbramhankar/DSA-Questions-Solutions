Swap odd and even bits

Given an unsigned integer n, You have  to swap all even-position bits with their rightside adjacent odd-position bits.

Examples:

Input: n = 23
Output: 43
Explanation: Binary representation of the given number  is 00010111 after swapping  00101011 = 43 in decimal.

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: Binary representation of the given number is 10 after swapping 01 = 1 in decimal.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 109
