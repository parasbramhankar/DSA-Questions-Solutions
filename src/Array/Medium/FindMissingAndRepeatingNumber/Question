link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-missing-and-repeating2512/1

Given an unsorted array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, it is known that one number in this range is missing, and another number occurs twice in the array, find both the duplicate number and the missing number.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 2]
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and the missing number is 1.

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3]
Output: [3, 2]
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and the missing number is 2.

Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 5]
Explanation: Repeating number is 1 and the missing number is 5.
Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
