122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given
stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock.You can only hold at most
one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell
it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.



Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

Example 3:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.


Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

# Problem Explanation

You are given an array `prices` where:

* prices\[i] represents the price of the stock on the i-th day.

You can:

* Buy at most one share at a time (you cannot hold multiple shares).
* You can buy and sell on the same day.
* You can make as many transactions as you like, as long as you sell before buying again.

Goal:

* Maximize the total profit you can achieve.

\=====================================================================================
What’s allowed?

* You can buy on one day and sell on a later day to make profit.
* You can do this multiple times (buy, sell, buy, sell, ...), as long as you sell before buying again.
* You can even buy and sell on the same day, though that usually doesn't add profit unless next price is higher.

What’s not allowed?

* You cannot hold more than one stock at a time.
* You must sell before buying again.

\=====================================================================================
How does profit work?

Whenever you buy at price x and sell later at price y,
your profit is y - x.

The goal is to sum up these individual profits from multiple transactions
to get the maximum overall profit.

\=====================================================================================
Examples

Example 1:

Input: prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4]

Day 0: price = 7
Day 1: price = 1 -> buy
Day 2: price = 5 -> sell (profit = 5-1 = 4)
Day 3: price = 3 -> buy
Day 4: price = 6 -> sell (profit = 6-3 = 3)
Day 5: price = 4

Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7

---

Example 2:

Input: prices = \[1,2,3,4,5]

You could:

* Buy on day 0 and sell on day 4 (profit = 5 - 1 = 4)

Or you could break it down:

* Buy on day 0, sell on day 1: profit = 2-1 = 1
* Buy on day 1, sell on day 2: profit = 3-2 = 1
* Buy on day 2, sell on day 3: profit = 4-3 = 1
* Buy on day 3, sell on day 4: profit = 5-4 = 1

Total profit = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

---

Example 3:

Input: prices = \[7,6,4,3,1]

Prices are always dropping, so no profit can be made.

Any buy-sell would give you sell - buy <= 0.

Total profit = 0.

\=====================================================================================
Key Insight

This problem is basically about capturing all the "uphill" climbs in the stock price.

* If prices\[i+1] > prices\[i], you can make profit by buying on day i and selling on day i+1.
* Adding up all these small profits gives the maximum total profit.

So you want to accumulate all the little increases in prices.

\=====================================================================================
Summary

* Buy and sell as many times as needed (as long as you sell before buying again).
* Try to capture every rise in price, whether it’s over many days or consecutive days.
* The final answer is the sum of all these profits.
