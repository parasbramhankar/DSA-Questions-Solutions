âœ… Approach â€“ Maximum Consecutive 1s (Optimized)

The goal of this function is to find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in
a binary array (i.e., an array that contains only `0`s and `1`s).

Core Idea:

1. As we traverse the array, we track how many 1s are occurring consecutively.
2. When we encounter a `0`, we:
  * Check if the current streak (`count`) is the longest so far.
  * Reset `count` to `0` because the sequence of `1s` has been interrupted.
3 At the end, we ensure that if the array ends with a streak of `1s`, it's also considered for the maximum.

ðŸ”¹Step-by-Step Logic:

1. Initialize two variables:
   * `count` â†’ Keeps track of the current number of consecutive 1s.
   * `maxCount` â†’ Stores the maximum number of consecutive 1s found so far.
2. Iterate through each element of the array:
   a. If the element is `1`, increment `count`.
   B. If the element is `0`, it means the streak is broken:
     * Compare `count` with `maxCount` and update `maxCount` if needed.
     * Reset `count` to `0`.
3. After the loop ends:
   * The array may end with `1s`, and we havenâ€™t updated `maxCount` after the last streak.
   * So, we take `Math.max(maxCount, count)` to return the final answer.
----------

Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: `O(n)` â€” we traverse the array once.
Space Complexity: `O(1)` â€” only two integer variables are used.
----------

ðŸ”¹ Example:

Input: `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`
Output: `3`
Explanation:

* First streak: `1, 1` â†’ length = 2
* Break at `0`
* Second streak: `1, 1, 1` â†’ length = 3 (max)

# âœ… Use Case Summary:

| Element | Action      | `count` | `maxCount` |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `1`     | `+1`        | 1       | 0          |
| `1`     | `+1`        | 2       | 0          |
| `0`     | reset       | 0       | 2          |
| `1`     | `+1`        | 1       | 2          |
| `1`     | `+1`        | 2       | 2          |
| `1`     | `+1`        | 3       | 2          |
| (end)   | final check | -       | 3          |
