‚úÖ Step-by-step Logic

1. Sort the array:
   Sorting helps bring closer elements together. After sorting, the difference between max and min of any subarray of size `m` is simply the difference between the first and last elements of that subarray.

2. Slide a window of size `m` over the sorted array:
   For every window (from `i` to `i+m-1`), calculate the difference between the max and min of that group: `arr[i+m-1] - arr[i]`.

3. Track the minimum of these differences:
   This gives us the most ‚Äúfair‚Äù group (i.e., the one with the smallest difference between the largest and smallest values).

üîç Example
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 100, 40, 60, 70};
int m = 3;

// Sorted array = {10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 100}

// Windows of size 3:
// {10,20,30} ‚Üí diff = 20
// {20,30,40} ‚Üí diff = 20
// {30,40,60} ‚Üí diff = 30
// {40,60,70} ‚Üí diff = 30
// {60,70,100} ‚Üí diff = 40
// Min of these = 20 ‚Üí returned



Time Complexity: O(n*log n)
