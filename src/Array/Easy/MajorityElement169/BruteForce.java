/*

Approach: Using the nested for-loop

This brute-force method is used to find the majority element in an array.
A majority element is defined as the element that appears more than n/2 times in the array,
where n is the size of the array.

Steps:
1. Iterate through each element of the array using index i.

2. For each element at i, count how many times it appears in the array by
   comparing it with every other element using another loop with index j.

3. If the count of the current element exceeds n/2, return that element as
   the majority.

4. If no such element is found after checking all elements, return -1.

This approach has O(nÂ²) time complexity due to the nested loops, which makes
it inefficient for large arrays.
