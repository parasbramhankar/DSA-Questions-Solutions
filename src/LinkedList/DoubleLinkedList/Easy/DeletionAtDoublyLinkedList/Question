Delete in a Doubly Linked List

Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/delete-node-in-doubly-linked-list/1

You are given a Doubly Linked List and an integer x. Remove the node at position x (positions are 1-indexed) from the list, and return the head of the updated list.

Examples:

Input: x = 3,

Output: 1 <-> 3
Explanation: After deleting the node at position 3 (position starts from 1), the updated linked list is 1 <-> 3.

Input: x = 1,

Output: 5 <-> 2 <-> 9
Explanation: After deleting the node at position 1, the updated linked list is 5 <-> 2 <-> 9.

Constraints:
1 ≤ x ≤ size of the linked list ≤ 106
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 104
