ðŸ”¢What is the Problem?


For example:

`5! = 120` â†’ 3 digits
`10! = 3,628,800` â†’ 7 digits

 But for large numbers like `100!`, the value is enormous:
100! = 933,262,154,439... (158 digits long!)

So if you try to compute it normally for big numbers,
the result is **too large for most data types** (even `BigInteger` can be slow).
